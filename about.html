              <h4>Reading Books:-</h4>
              <p>
               Reading frequently does actually make you smarter. Not only does it help you retain knowledge,<br>
                but it helps you to remember that knowledge later on in life. Whether or not you realize it, <br>
                Reading stockpiles your brain with new information, and you never know when it may come in handy.

              <h4>VolleyBall:-</h4>
              <p>
                Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.<br>
                 Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.<br>
                  It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.<br> 
                  I am National level Player of VolleyBall.

              <h4>Gardening</h4>
              <p>
                Gardening is my <b>hobby</b>. It brings me in touch with the green plants and flowers and filled my lungs with pure Oxygen.<br>
                 The great <i>pleasure</i> we get from planting, growing flowers and some vegetables of the season is not comparable with any other feelings.<br>

                 Gardening as a hobby is more than <b>recreational</b>, it has everlasting benefits.
                 <i>Gardening rejuvenates our minds.</i>
