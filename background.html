         <h4>Beautiful Country</h4>
         <p>
             India is part of the continent of Asia. Most of India forms a peninsula, which means it is surrounded by water on three sides.<br>
             Society throughout India is divided into social ranks, called castes. Caste is determined by birth and there is almost no way to change it.<br>
             High castes include priests, landowners, and soldiers. So-called Untouchables have no caste and do the most menial jobs.<br>
             India is a very spiritual country. It has no official religion, but more than 80 percent of Indians are Hindu.<br>
             About 13 percent are Muslim. Other religions include Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism, which all began in India.<br>
             On the coast of the Bay of Bengal is the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. Here, tigers swim in the same rivers as dolphins,<br> 
             sea turtles, sharks, and saltwater crocodiles. This unique landscape is constantly under threat as sea levels rise and humans hunt 
             illegally and clear trees for firewood.
